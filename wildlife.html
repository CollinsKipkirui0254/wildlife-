    <p>   <br><h2 style="text-align: center">The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) conserves and manages Kenya’s wildlife for the Kenyan people and the world.</h2></br>
     <div> It is a state corporation that was established by an Act of Parliament (Cap 376), now repealed by WCMA
       (2013), with the mandate to conserve and manage wildlife in Kenya, and to enforce related laws and regulations.
       KWS undertakes conservation and management of wildlife resources across all protected areas systems in collaboration
             with stakeholders. It is our goal to work with others to conserve, protect and sustainably manage wildlife resources.
       The community wildlife program of KWS in collaboration with others encourages biodiversity conservation by communities
       living on land essential to wildlife, such as wildlife corridors and dispersal lands outside parks and reserves.
       The premise is that " if people benefit from wildlife and other natural resources, then they will take care of
       these resources."</div>
