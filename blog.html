          <h3>RARE SPECIES OF HORSES</h3>
        <p>
            <br>According to a genetic study, horses were first domesticated about 6,000 years ago.
            The first domestic horses were in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, though they
            quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. These horses were used for a variety of
            purposes, including meat, milk, and of course, riding.</br>

            <br>Climate change and environmental degradation lead to an ever-increasing number of species
            getting extinct. Humans must strive to ensure the planet’s preservation. It has become a
            need of the hour to protect and take due measures for the protection of our wildlife.
            Through this blog, we will take a look at wildlife administration and see what is wildlife
            management, the job it plays in the preservation and the best career options to choose in
            this field of flora and fauna along with trending courses, universities and admission
            procedures.</br>
